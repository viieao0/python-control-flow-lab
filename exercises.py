# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to help you understand how to write code "inside" a provided Python function.
#
# We'll create a function that checks a condition and prints a specific greeting message based on that condition.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function is named `print_greeting`.
# - Inside the function, declare a variable `python_is_fun` and set it to `True`.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if `python_is_fun` is `True`.
# - If `python_is_fun` is `True`, print the message "Python is fun!"

def print_greeting():
    # Your code goes here. Remember to indent!
    python_is_fun = True
    if python_is_fun:
        print("Python is fun!")

# Call the function
print_greeting()

# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
        # Your control flow logic goes here
    letter = input('enter a letter (a-z or A-Z):').lower ()
    if letter in ['e','a','o','u','i']:
        print(f"The letter {letter} is a vowel.") 
    else:
        print(f"The letter {letter} is a consonant.")
# Call the function
check_letter()

# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here


    # Check if the input is digits only
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))  

    if age < 0: 
        print("Age cannot be negative.")
    else:  
        voting_age = 18
        if age >= voting_age:  
            print("You are eligible to vote.")
        else:  
            print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()


# Exercise 3: Calculate Dog Years
#
# Write a Python function named `calculate_dog_years` that calculates a dog's age in dog years.
# Fill in the logic to perform the calculation inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to enter a dog's age: "Input a dog's age: "
# - Calculate the dog's age in dog years:
#      - The first two years of the dog's life count as 10 dog years each.
#      - Each subsequent year counts as 7 dog years.
# - Print the calculated age: "The dog's age in dog years is xx."
# - Replace 'xx' with the calculated dog years.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Convert the string input to an integer using `int()`.
# - Apply conditional logic to perform the correct age calculation based on the dog's age.

def calculate_dog_years():
     # Your control flow logic goes here
     age =int(input('input a dogs age:'))
     if (age<2):
         print(age*10)
     else:
         print(20+((age-2)*7))

# Call the function
calculate_dog_years()

# Exercise 4: Weather Advice
#
# Write a Python script named `weather_advice` that provides clothing advice based on weather conditions.
#
# Requirements:
# - The script should prompt the user to enter if it is cold (yes/no).
# - Then, ask if it is raining (yes/no).
# - Use logical operators to determine clothing advice:
#   - If it is cold AND raining, print "Wear a waterproof coat."
#   - If it is cold BUT NOT raining, print "Wear a warm coat."
#   - If it is NOT cold but raining, print "Carry an umbrella."
#   - If it is NOT cold AND NOT raining, print "Wear light clothing."
#
# Hints:
# - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in your if statements to handle multiple conditions.

    # Your control flow logic goes here
def weather_advice():
    cold = input("Is it cold? (yes/no): ").lower()
    raining = input("Is it raining? (yes/no): ").lower()

    if cold == "yes" and raining == "yes":
        print("Wear a waterproof coat.")
    elif cold == "yes" and raining == "no":
        print("Wear a warm coat.")
    elif cold == "no" and raining == "yes":
        print("Carry an umbrella.")
    elif cold == "no" and raining == "no":
        print("Wear light clothing.")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please answer with yes or no.")

# Call the function
weather_advice()
def fizz_buzz():
    for i in range(1, 51):  # loop from 1 to 50
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:  # divisible by both 3 and 5
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:  # 3 only
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:  # 5 only
            print("Buzz")
        else:  # not 3 5
            print(i)

# Call the function
fizz_buzz()
